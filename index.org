#+begin_verse
I startes to manage my themes, actually only one, I get rid off the /doom-themes/.
and add the atom-one-dark theme, lets see what will happend,
I actually like this theme the most, the only thing that is an issue from me
is the actual fonts management, so Im going to "hack" this theme a little bit.
