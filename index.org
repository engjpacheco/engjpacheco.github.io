* Description
- This is my simple personal website written original as a org file and exported to html (because of course, i had to say that i use emacs and org-mode :D)
- Like i said this is just a personal website, it doesn't represent a specific topic, but pretty much all my tastes and passions but not exactly all, because while i like to dance (i even compite and i'm in academias) i won't talk about that here, i will talk about other stuff, like:
  1. GNU/Linux & technology in general
  2. Philosophy
  3. Masculinity
  4. Emacs & org-mode
  5. Self-development
  6. Religion
  7. Politics
  8. Etc.
* Topics to talk
- Minimalist software vs productivity
- Based RSS chad vs Social media coomer
- God as a representation of overall goodness and light & not as a religious dogmatic figure
- Why the best text editor doesn't exist, but there are better than others
